        <p>Hello, I'm Andrew Connelly I'm a currently enrolled USC Columbia undergraduate pursuing a degree in Intergrated Information Technology.
            I was initally pursuing a degree in Computer Scienc, but switched I learned basic C++ and Java programming. 
            Through my new degree I've learned various other skills such as HTML and CSS programming and basic Networking skills. 
            I currently work as an IT helper in the Math Department at USC.
            I currently do not have any certifications to show but fully intend to pursue one in the new future. </p>
